# Interactive Media Project 1

This project was created for the Course "Interactive Media Project 1" at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences. The repository contains the code and the corresponding paper for a prototype that generates landscape-like 3D meshes with a focus on customizing options for the user. Further improved versions of these meshes could, for example, be used as terrain in video games or movie backgrounds.

## How to use

The "IAM-Project 1" directory contains a Unity project that can be imported. By starting the runtime engine inside Unity, a standard mesh will be created by default. The user can adjust different parameters of the "TerrainGenerator" component to alter the results.

## Technologies

* C#
* Unity 2021.1.7f1
* LaTeX

## Result Preview

In this section, some screenshots of the project results are displayed. Take a look at the corresponding paper named "Marcus-Gagelmann_IAM-Projekt-1.pdf" for detailed information about the project. Currently, the paper is only available in German, though.
